## Welcome!

We at Circles USA think having information is in everyone’s best interest. The better the tools we have, the better we can solve problems. So wouldn’t better tools to understand the cliff effect that can occur when people move off assistance programs be good? Wouldn’t we be better able to plan for the future?

## Planning Tools while we wait for the fix in benefits. . .

Assistance programs use complex formulas, making it virtually impossible for a family with low income, or a community volunteer, or even most human service staff, to determine in advance how much assistance people will have once they earn more income. This is a problem because as people earn more income, they disproportionately lose work supports like childcare assistance, health insurance, etc., which undermines progress out of poverty. The result dismantles the survival budget while people are trying to move closer to their stability budget.

We need to take the mystery out of the equation so that people can adequately plan for losses in subsidies as they generate more earned income. (Just as important, of course, the cliff effect must be removed and replaced with prorated schedules that provide smooth exit ramps off work-support assistance programs. Circles works on this front, too.)

A Circles USA volunteer Advisor from Connellsville, PA, David Priemer, has built a prototype-planning tool calibrated for all counties in 10 states that will predict losses in each of the 5 major programs for 18 different levels of income. Circles Leaders and volunteers can fill out asset, demographic info and where they live and the calculator instantly lets them know how they rate on each of 7 tests for the 5 different benefits. The calculator examines subsidies as Leaders move between their current income and expected income, up to 200% of the federal poverty level.

Our new web based version of this tool makes it possible to run the analysis from anywhere with internet access.
