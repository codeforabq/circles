# Circles USA Cliff Effect Planning Tool (CEPT)

# Integration with EveryAction

Circles USA uses a Customer Relation Manager (CRM) called EveryAction.
It's a complex product tailored for non-profits, based on voter management systems used by the Clinton and Obama campaigns, commercialized into a product called [VAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGP_VAN).

More information for developers is available at [EveryAction's Developer Portal](http://developers.everyaction.com/).
